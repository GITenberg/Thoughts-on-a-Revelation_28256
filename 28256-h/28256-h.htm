1</span>THOUGHTS ON A REVELATION.</h2>
<p>Few persons can have observed attentively the various phases
of public opinion on religious subjects during the last twenty
years or more, without noticing a growing tendency to the
accumulation of difficulties on the subject of Revelation.&nbsp;
Geology, ethnology, mythical interpretation, critical
investigation, and inquiries of other kinds, have raised their
several difficulties; and, in consequence, infidels have
rejoiced, candid inquirers have been perplexed, and even those
who have held with firmness decided views on the distinctive
character of the inspiration of the Bible, have sometimes found
it difficult to satisfy their minds entirely, and to see clearly
the grounds of their conclusions.</p>
<p>The writer of these pages does not propose to attempt a
detailed reply to the various difficulties which have been
raised.&nbsp; Answers to objections arising from the pursuit of
particular sciences are most effectually given by those, who have
made those sciences their study; nor can there be any doubt that,
if the book of nature and the Bible spring from the same source,
an increasing acquaintance with both will tend to show their
harmony with each other, and to dispel the perplexities which
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>have arisen from an imperfect acquaintance with either of
them.&nbsp; It may be observed, too, that, as it requires special
knowledge on the part of a writer to cope with special
difficulties; so also does it demand acquirements, but rarely
found, on the part of the reader, to appreciate the real value,
both of the objections and answers which may be made on
geological, critical, or other special grounds.</p>
<p>The writer thinks that there is another method of
reply&mdash;a method which consists in giving as clear a view as
can be had of the real character of the subject against which the
objections are made; and this is the kind of answer which he
proposes to attempt.&nbsp; The man who has a distinct and well
defined knowledge of chemical, mathematical, or any other
science, will not be greatly perplexed with difficulties which
may be brought from other sciences, touching upon that with which
he is acquainted.&nbsp; The knowledge which he possesses of his
own particular science will enable him, in some instances, to
perceive at once the weakness of the objections which are
alleged; and, even when this is not the case, he will see such an
harmonious proportion subsisting between the various parts of
that branch of knowledge which he has been pursuing, and be so
strongly convinced of the certainty of it, that he will be justly
disposed to attribute to his own ignorance his inability to give
satisfactory replies to those difficulties which he cannot
dispose of.&nbsp; <i>Real</i> knowledge cannot of course be
overthrown; and, although it is often difficult to decide what
knowledge is of this description, the task of arriving at a
tolerably correct conclusion with regard to such subjects as fall
within the range of our faculties, must not be regarded as an
hopeless one.</p>
<p>When clear definitions have been given, disputants <!-- page
3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>have
often found that there is no further room for discussion; and,
even when this is not the case, the force of objections can,
under such circumstances, be more accurately weighed, and the
real points of attack and defence more clearly perceived.&nbsp;
If a man were to say, in a mixed company, that there was no taste
in an apple, many sensible men, unacquainted with his exact
meaning, might be inclined to dispute the assertion, and to say
that the statement was contrary to common experience; but, if he
explained his meaning to be, that taste is a quality of a
sentient being, and that there is nothing in the apple of this
kind, or corresponding to it, everybody then would see the truth
of his assertion, and all ground of dispute would be
removed.&nbsp; We will take another case.&nbsp; Those who hold
strong Protestant views frequently say, that the &ldquo;religion
of the Bible is the religion of Protestants.&rdquo; This, for
most purposes, expresses their meaning forcibly and well, and the
mind, in practice, usually supplies the necessary
limitations.&nbsp; It does not, however, always happen that these
limitations are consciously present to the mind, or that the
person who practically receives the right impression might not be
greatly puzzled by the subtle reasonings of objectors.&nbsp; The
<i>dictum</i>, quoted above, does not mean, as might at first
sight appear, that we are to make use of no other means than the
Bible in the investigation of Divine truth, and that the wisdom
of the present and past ages is to go for nothing.&nbsp; No one
<i>could</i> thus isolate himself from other influences; and, if
he could, it would not be <i>desirable</i>.&nbsp; What is really
meant is, that all truth necessary for salvation is contained in
the Bible, &ldquo;so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may
be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it
should be believed <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>as an article of faith,&rdquo; etc.;
in other words, that the Bible is the ultimate and sole standard
of appeal.&nbsp; This of course may be, and is disputed; but,
when the statement is put in a clear and well defined shape, many
apparent objections vanish at once, and the real points of attack
and defence are made evident.&nbsp; If, then, we can obtain
ideas, on the subject of revelation, which shall be, upon the
whole, distinct, and worthy of being received as true, much will
be done to remove objections, and to satisfy a reasonable
mind.</p>
<p>The proposed investigation will necessarily be, in some
degree, of an <i>a priori</i> character; not, however, as we
trust, so much so as to render it vague and without practical
value.&nbsp; It will be <i>a priori</i>, inasmuch as it will not
assume the existence of a revelation, and then proceed to examine
its character.&nbsp; This would be to beg the question at
issue.&nbsp; It will not be <i>a priori</i>, so far as it
consists in instituting an inquiry into the faculties of the
human mind, and their capacity to receive a revelation; and into
this it will be found that the investigation will mainly resolve
itself.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>1.&nbsp; We may commence our inquiry into the subject by
noticing, <i>that a knowledge of God</i>, <i>to be obtained in
some way or other</i>, <i>seems almost essential to the
well-being of man</i>.&nbsp; If it be granted, that there is such
a Being&mdash;and few, it is presumed, would go so far as to deny
this&mdash;it must be of great importance for us to know the
relationship in which that Being stands to us, and we to
Him.&nbsp; We can hardly suppose it possible that an Infinite
Being, in some sense, as we suppose will be generally allowed,
the Governor of the world, should not have an important relation
to <i>all</i> other existences; much less, that the relation <!--
page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>which He bears to <i>man</i>, the most noble existence of
which we have any actual experience, should be of an
insignificant character.&nbsp; Looking, too, upon man as a free
and moral agent, accountable, as conscience declares, for his
actions to his fellow-men, it seems almost certain that he must
be also responsible for his acts in relation to the Deity.&nbsp;
The general belief of mankind, in all ages and in all places,
tends to the same conclusion; and, if it be admitted that there
is an eternal world into which the consequences of our actions
follow us, a knowledge of the relationship in which we stand to
God becomes of still greater importance.&nbsp; But if this
knowledge probably may be, and, should the general belief of the
world have a foundation in fact, certainly is, of great
importance, it can hardly be supposed that a God of love would
allow us to remain in ignorance of it; and the question arises,
<i>how it is to be obtained</i>.</p>
<p>It may be observed, first of all, that <i>the Deity does
not</i>, <i>like other objects</i>, <i>come within the direct
cognizance of our perceptive faculties</i>.&nbsp; We have an
organization, by means of which we are enabled to perceive
various objects around us; and, by travelling to other lands, we
can obtain a knowledge of many things of which we had before been
ignorant.&nbsp; We perceive also what is going on within
us.&nbsp; The telescope and the microscope reveal to us wonders
which, without their intervention, we could never have
discovered.&nbsp; But we cannot through the instrumentality of
any of our faculties perceive God.&nbsp; Travel where we will we
cannot find Him out.&nbsp; No appliance of art has availed to
disclose Him to us.&nbsp; If any philosophers conceive that they
can intuitively gaze upon God, other philosophers declare their
ignorance of any intuition of this kind, and assuredly the common
people, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>who most stand in need of clear
notions on the subject, and who would hardly be neglected by a
beneficent God, are altogether unconscious of it.&nbsp; The
knowledge of Him, therefore, if obtained at all, must be had in
some other way.</p>
<p>But may not an adequate knowledge of God be obtained <i>by the
exercise of the faculties of the human mind upon external
nature</i>, <i>or in some other way</i>?&nbsp; The Apostle St.
Paul says something which rather favours this view, when he
declares that &ldquo;the invisible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that
they are without excuse&rdquo; (Rom. i. 20): and we believe that
a considerable insight into the nature of God, and the probable
character of His dealings with us may be obtained in the manner
to which we have referred.&nbsp; Still we have only to look at
the ever varying and degrading notions which have, at all times,
prevailed in many parts of the world respecting the Divine Being,
to perceive that a more clear method of obtaining knowledge about
Him would, to say the least of it, be a most valuable boon.&nbsp;
The method under consideration has not practically issued as we
might have hoped that it would; and therefore there is reason to
expect, that God might make use of some more direct way of
communicating to us a knowledge of Himself.</p>
<p>Another possible mode of communicating a knowledge of God
would be, <i>by implanting in the mind of man</i>, <i>an idea
corresponding</i>, <i>so far as might be needful</i>, <i>to the
nature of God</i>.&nbsp; But a belief in the existence of
anything of this kind is open to several objections.&nbsp; If
such an idea existed, it must, to answer the required end, be
sufficiently clear and well defined to give at least a tolerably
accurate <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>notion of the Deity, and must also
bring with it a well-grounded conviction of its correspondence to
the reality.&nbsp; But the variety of opinions which have been
entertained on the subject forbid us to believe that any such
idea as this exists.&nbsp; Search as far as we can into our own
minds, we are unable to discover anything approaching to such a
notion of the Divinity.&nbsp; It appears too, that,
notwithstanding some speculations as to time and space, which, in
the opinion of some, bear a slightly exceptional character, there
is no good reason to believe that we acquire other kinds of
knowledge in the manner under consideration; and, if this be so,
there is a strong presumption against a knowledge of the Deity
being obtained in this way.</p>
<p>As however some confusion of mind not uncommonly prevails on
this subject, we will endeavour to explain our meaning more
fully.&nbsp; We possess, as it appears to us, certain capacities
for obtaining knowledge, and for retaining, and disposing our
knowledge, when obtained, in different ways; but we are not born
with the actual possession of knowledge; nor, so far as we can
see, is knowledge, at any subsequent time, obtained by us, except
by means of the capabilities to which we have referred.&nbsp; We
have by nature powers of knowing objects, both external to our
organization, and internal; but the objects themselves, and not
the representations of them, are presented to us before we know
them.&nbsp; We are conscious of seeing, and smelling, and
tasting, and feeling, etc.; but they are the things themselves
which we see, and smell, and taste, and feel, in the first
instance, although afterwards we are able to contemplate the
representations of them which are formed in the mind.&nbsp; There
is within us, no doubt, a capability of apprehending, <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>in a
sufficient degree, the perfections of God, when they are declared
to us; but a knowledge of these perfections does not naturally
exist within us.&nbsp; We conclude, then, that, as the Deity is
not directly perceived by us, has not in practice been adequately
discerned by any process of the mind, and is not made known to us
by any connate, or subsequently implanted idea, we must be
indebted to revelation, in the main, for any knowledge we may
obtain respecting Him.&nbsp; We do not consider it necessary to
enter into a discussion of Pantheistic views, inasmuch as we have
yet to learn that Pantheism has ever furnished any definite ideas
respecting the nature of God which will bear the test of a close
examination as to their reality.&nbsp; We think, too, that it is
destructive of the personality of either God, or man, or both,
and thus does away with all real relation between the two.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the investigation of what we mean by a
revelation, we will endeavour to answer an objection which may be
raised.&nbsp; It may be alleged that, if a true knowledge of God
is of such great consequence to man, it appears strange that such
differing opinions should have been held on the subject, and that
God&rsquo;s revelation&mdash;on the supposition that there is
one&mdash;should not have been more extensively promulgated, and
declared with more irresistible evidence.&nbsp; There is no doubt
a difficulty here.&nbsp; It does not however attach
<i>especially</i> to the subject of a revelation; but meets us at
all points, when we consider the unequal distribution of the
blessings of nature.&nbsp; Why many persons should be destitute
of the advantages which others enjoy, and why some should pass a
life of suffering, while others are surrounded with every
comfort, are questions which naturally arise in the minds of
reflecting men, but which <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>have hitherto remained without full
and satisfactory answers.&nbsp; He who would give a complete
reply must have clearer views, than have yet been obtained, with
regard to the origin of evil.&nbsp; It may be observed too that,
on the supposition that the Bible is a real revelation from God,
and bearing in mind the vast number of the human race to whom it
has already been given, and its capability of future
communication, it far more nearly meets the difficulty, than
abstruse speculations respecting the Deity, which can scarcely be
apprehended even by philosophers, and which are to the mass
wholly unintelligible.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let us now examine <i>the conditions under which a
revelation may be expected to be given to the original
recipients</i>.</p>
<p>It may be observed in the first place that a revelation
<i>must possess some distinctive character</i>.&nbsp; Even, if it
should turn out that there is no such thing in reality at all, at
least the notion which we form in our minds must possess such
points of difference as to distinguish it from all other
notions.&nbsp; It appears needful to bear this in mind, obvious
though it is, because there are not a few, in the present day,
who deprive the word, revelation, of nearly all the
distinguishing features which have commonly been supposed to
attach to it, and so extend the meaning of the word inspiration
as &ldquo;sometimes to believe it in poets, legislators,
philosophers, and others gifted with high genius,&rdquo; (Essays
and Reviews, p. 140).&nbsp; What this means it is hard to
say.&nbsp; Shakespeare, Milton, Newton, and others certainly did
not imagine that they had direct communication with God; that
they revealed to us His nature, and the relation in which He
stands to <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>us; predicted future events, etc., in
the same sense that Moses, David, Isaiah, and the other writers
of the Bible are supposed to have done.&nbsp; If they actually
did anything of this kind, they were assuredly wholly unconscious
of their power; nor, we may add, has common opinion held that
they afforded information on the same subjects as those which the
writers of the Bible handled.&nbsp; Admirers of our poets, and
philosophers, have not considered it necessary to promulgate what
they have found in their writings, as matters in which the
spiritual, and, possibly, eternal interests of man are vitally
concerned; although believers in the Bible, and even in Mahomet,
have done so.&nbsp; The word inspiration, in fact, as used in the
passage above quoted, involves a confusion of ideas which we
should hardly have expected to find in the writings of any one
who professed to speak accurately, and appears scarcely
pardonable, or even honest, in the case of so acute a thinker, as
the late Mr. Baden Powell.&nbsp; We are not now saying that the
Bible is a revelation from God, or even that there is such a
thing as a distinctive revelation at all.&nbsp; All we assert is,
that the idea of such a thing is a very common one, and that it
is very different from that which is usually held with regard to
the works of Newton, Milton, and other gifted sages and
philosophers.&nbsp; We might add, in passing, that, unless the
Bible be an imposture&mdash;in which case it ought to be regarded
as far inferior to the works of genuine and truthful poets and
philosophers&mdash;it does correspond, as we trust will be seen,
on an examination of its contents, to the idea referred to.</p>
<p>Still further, revelation must not only have some distinctive
character; but, in order to be effectual for its purpose, <i>it
should carry along with it</i>, <i>to the original
recipients</i>, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span><i>a reasonable conviction of its
authenticity</i>.&nbsp; The Bible speaks of several professed
modes of communication, and accepting them according to the
ordinary meaning of words, and not in any mythical, or
ideological sense, they appear to be such as might answer for the
purpose of authentication.&nbsp; The Lord talked with
Abraham.&nbsp; He appeared in a burning bush to Moses, spake to
him and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai, and conversed with
him afterwards on the top of that mountain, during a period of
forty days.&nbsp; He spake in the night to Samuel.&nbsp; He
appeared in a vision to Isaiah and others.&nbsp; To some He made
Himself known in dreams.&nbsp; Christ spake to His
disciples.&nbsp; All these are evidently ways in which God might
communicate with man; and there is no difficulty in supposing
that the attendant circumstances, such for instance as some of
those recorded in the Bible, might be of such a kind as to
authenticate the communication.&nbsp; It would be idle to argue
that, because God does not make Himself known in any of these
ways now, He has never done so; for, to omit other
considerations, we may observe that, in accordance with the
economy which prevails in the works of God, we have no reason to
suppose that He would make special revelations to more persons
than might be necessary for the purpose He had in view.&nbsp; If
He revealed Himself to them, the promulgation of the revelation
would be naturally and safely left to more ordinary
instrumentality.&nbsp; At the present time, so far as Christians
are concerned, they do not expect a special revelation to
themselves, because, as they believe, God has already
communicated all that He desires them to know.</p>
<p>But supposing a revelation to be sufficiently
authenticated,&mdash;What may be reasonably expected as to the
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span><i>extent</i> of it?&nbsp; It is, we think, clear in the
first place that <i>no perfect knowledge of God and His relation
to us could be communicated</i>.&nbsp; Even if a direct
presentation of the Infinite were given, the capacity of man
could not grasp it, and therefore the result would be a finite
conception; and, if the revelation were made by words or other
signs, it is plain that these can only express the finite ideas
of which they are the symbols.</p>
<p>Nor is there anything in this which need excite our surprise;
for the limited nature of our knowledge with regard to God would
be analogous to that which we have about other things.&nbsp;
There is nothing with regard to which our knowledge is not
limited.&nbsp; Some may be ready to affirm that we do not know
things in themselves at all, but only the effects produced upon
us, or their relation to us.&nbsp; We are not about to maintain
this proposition; but it is at any rate plain that the most
familiar objects, as science advances, often disclose to us new
qualities, and that we have no reason to suppose that we are
fully acquainted with all the qualities of even the simplest
substances.&nbsp; There is no reason to expect that the book of
revelation should be more explicit than that of nature.</p>
<p>Not only, however, <i>must</i> our knowledge, derived from
revelation, be, in some degree, limited; but it is not difficult
to see, why <i>it would be probably kept even within the range of
what it is possible for us to know</i>.&nbsp; We can readily
understand that the object of God in making a revelation would be
to inform us about those things only, a knowledge of which might
be essential to our interests; and here again the analogy of the
natural world comes in to assist us.&nbsp; God has given to each
existence such qualities as are requisite for the position in
which it is placed.&nbsp; Ascending through the various classes
of animals, we <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>find, as we advance, the capacities
for knowledge increasing, and bearing a relation to their actual
circumstances.&nbsp; The mole is not endowed with the far-seeing
vision which is essential to the well-being of the eagle: nor, on
the other hand, has the eagle the power of threading its way
through the earth, without which the mole could not exist.&nbsp;
Viewing man in relation to the natural world, we find that he has
the power of obtaining that kind of knowledge which is necessary
to his welfare here, although, in many respects, he is far
surpassed by the keener perceptions of the inferior
animals.&nbsp; God has in fact ordered and limited his knowledge
with an express reference to the position which he is called upon
to occupy.&nbsp; This throws light upon the subject of
revelation.&nbsp; It is reasonable to expect that God would limit
the knowledge communicated in that way also, by a consideration
of the state in which man is placed here, and of that which, upon
the supposition of a future state, he is to occupy hereafter.</p>
<p>So far as we have yet gone, there does not appear to be any
reason why the knowledge, although limited, should not be
accurate as far as it goes.&nbsp; Though we do not know all the
properties of particular objects, we may know some of them, and
may also safely reason about those with which we are acquainted,
so long as we are careful not to introduce into the reasoning
anything which does not result from our actual knowledge; and so,
turning from nature to a revelation, we may learn much from it
about God, as for instance, that He is a God of love and
holiness; that He will act towards us in a particular manner;
that He will punish some actions and recompense others; and this
knowledge also may be a true knowledge, so far as it goes, and
one that we may safely <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>act upon, although we may still be in
ignorance of His exact nature and many points of our relationship
to Him.</p>
<p>There is, however, a light in which revelation must be viewed,
which involves considerations of a somewhat different character
from those hitherto noticed, and to this we now turn.&nbsp; A
revelation must not only be limited by the extent of the human
capacity for receiving it, and by the proposed object of it, but
also, in a considerable degree, by <i>the state of knowledge
existing in the world at the time it is made</i>.&nbsp; In fact,
without some such limitation, it would be unintelligible, and,
consequently no revelation.&nbsp; As this truth has frequently
been misapplied, we will endeavour to explain, as accurately as
we can, our meaning.&nbsp; God could, perhaps, if He thought
proper, give in an ignorant age a revelation, as full and
explicit, as in a more enlightened period&mdash;a revelation we
mean which should be understood&mdash;but it must be remembered
that this could only be effected by altering the conditions under
which human knowledge is acquired.&nbsp; For example, to have
given a correct theory of the motions of the heavenly bodies,
before the age of Newton, would have been impossible, without an
entire change both in the existing state of knowledge, and also
in the method of acquiring it.&nbsp; Down to the present time all
history and experience testify to the fact that the acquisition
of knowledge is <i>gradual</i>; but such a revelation, as that to
which we have referred, would require that it should be made
<i>per saltum</i>.&nbsp; If knowledge were given in this way the
usual course would be completely changed; and not only so, but
the knowledge communicated would be altogether out of proportion
to that possessed on other points, and would place those who had
it in a false and unsatisfactory state with regard to the world
in which they lived.&nbsp; To <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>see this we
have only to picture to ourselves the condition of a man living
in a savage, or only partially civilized state of society, with
his mind preternaturally expanded to that of a Newton, and put
into possession of the knowledge which he had on some of those
subjects which the Bible touches on.&nbsp; How entirely out of
harmony would he be with his fellow-men, and everything around
him! and, how unable would he be even to pursue his studies for
want of those instruments, books, and appliances which a more
advanced state of society alone can produce!&nbsp; A revelation
of this kind would clearly not be a boon, but an injury to
him.&nbsp; It may be observed, moreover, that a revelation,
adapted to the knowledge even of a Newton, would neither exactly
correspond with facts, nor obviate all the difficulties which a
more enlightened age might discover.&nbsp; We do not stop to
dwell upon the obvious fact, that such a revelation, as that
which we have been noticing, would require not only a
preternatural expansion of faculties in the person to whom it was
made, but also a similar expansion, or, if not, a long
educational process in the case of all those who should receive
it.&nbsp; We conclude, then, that a revelation must be adapted
to, and in a great degree limited by, the state of knowledge
existing in the world at the time when such revelation is
made.</p>
<p>This leads us to a consideration of the <i>necessarily
phenomenal character of some portions of a revelation</i>,
respecting which objections against the Bible have been
frequently raised.&nbsp; We will, to explain our views, take as
an example, the familiar instance of the sun and earth.&nbsp;
According to appearance the sun moves, and the earth is
stationary: but science has demonstrated that the opposite to
this is the real state of the case.&nbsp; What line <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>might
it be expected that a revelation would take, when it had to deal
with a case of this kind?&nbsp; Should it speak according to
appearances, or realities?&nbsp; This, we believe, is the exact
point to be considered, and we do not think, when fairly put,
that it is one about which there is much difficulty.&nbsp; If a
revelation were given to an ignorant people, in accordance with
the reality, it is quite clear that they would not be in a
condition to receive it, and would therefore, probably, reject it
as absurd; but if the description were given according to the
appearance presented, then no difficulty would be felt.&nbsp; The
question, however, is pressed&mdash;whether such a mode of
representation is consistent with the truthfulness which may be
expected in a revelation.</p>
<p>It might, we think, be a sufficient reply to say that, as,
according to our former reasoning, it is, in many cases, the only
possible mode of revelation consistent with the established order
of things, we may well be content with it; but we will pursue the
subject a little further, with the view of making clear how the
matter stands.&nbsp; It may be observed that, if absolute truth
on a particular subject cannot be communicated, the nearest
approximation to it is, not only all that can be expected, but is
in itself highly desirable.&nbsp; If a man is unable to receive
as full an apprehension of a thing as we have ourselves, we must
endeavour to give him the most perfect information which he is
capable of receiving.&nbsp; We do not injure him by doing this,
but we should injure him if we omitted to do it.&nbsp; If a man,
who had lived all his life in the Arctic regions, and had never
heard of any other country, were to be brought to England, it
would not be necessary to tell him, with a view to his comfort
here, the motion of the earth with regard to the sun, and the
causes of the <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>length of our days and nights, and of
the variation of the seasons.&nbsp; To enter into these matters
would confuse his mind, and the man, if he had to earn his
living, would starve while he was acquiring the knowledge of
them.&nbsp; By such a course of proceeding we should, in reality,
do him a great injustice.&nbsp; Instead of attempting anything of
the kind, we should naturally give him such information as might
be requisite for his practical guidance, in a popular manner, and
leave to himself the acquisition of such scientific truth as he
might be desirous of becoming acquainted with.&nbsp; In a word,
we should describe to him things as they appear to be, and in
this respect our description would be, in a certain sense, true;
we should not describe them as they really are, and so far our
description would not be in strict accordance with the facts of
the case.&nbsp; We were about to say that it is a choice of
difficulties; but, is there any real difficulty in the
case?&nbsp; Does not the common sense of mankind declare that the
mode of proceeding which we have described is the only proper
one, and that there is no real untruthfulness in it?&nbsp; It may
be noticed too that even scientific men continually make use of
it amongst themselves, and in their intercourse with others, and
this without any charge of untruthfulness being brought against
them.&nbsp; What objection then can possibly lie against the
adoption of the same method in a revelation? <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; The supposed object of a
revelation is to save the soul, or, at least, to advance in a
material degree our spiritual interests.&nbsp; Is that to be put
aside till the world has learnt scientific truth, and is able to
converse in scientific <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>language?&nbsp; We feel no difficulty
in leaving the answer to this question to the common sense of
mankind in general.&nbsp; We conclude, then, that as phenomenal
truth is in many cases the only truth which can possibly be
afforded, and the imparting of it is a boon, and not an injury,
there is no reason why the Deity should not, when He sees fit,
make use of this mode of communication in revelation.</p>
<p>We will now notice, distinctly, <i>words as a medium of
revelation</i>.&nbsp; It is plain, that in communicating
knowledge, they are only effectual by calling up in the mind of
the hearer ideas <i>already</i> existing.&nbsp; To speak to a man
who has been blind from his birth, of colours would be useless,
because he has had no experience of them, and consequently no
ideas corresponding to them.&nbsp; Words may bring up ideas in a
different <i>combination</i> from any which had previously
existed in the mind of the person spoken to; but they cannot
<i>create</i> ideas.&nbsp; They may make the hearer acquainted
with something which he has never actually perceived; may cause
him to reason in a new manner; to see a familiar object in a
fresh light, or, in some other way, bring the faculties of the
mind into play; but still the mind, so far as instruction by
words is concerned, can only act upon its previous stores, and
analyze or combine them into new forms.&nbsp; This being the
case, it is clear that a revelation, so far as it is made by
words, must be limited by the ideas previously existing in the
mind of the person to whom it is made.&nbsp; These ideas, too,
however numerous and refined they may be, are limited by the
experience which a man has had of the external world, and of
himself.&nbsp; He cannot get beyond these.&nbsp; If, then, God
should think fit to reveal, in words, a knowledge of Himself, or
any other object which does not <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>come within
the direct cognizance of our perceptive faculties, this can only
be effected by calling up in the mind, through the words, some
new combination of ideas already possessed.&nbsp; This may not
correspond precisely with the object, respecting which the
revelation is made; but, as it is the only way in which a
revelation by words can be effected, we have no just reason to
find fault with it.&nbsp; All we have a right to expect, is that
the words should call up in the mind those ideas which best
represent the object designed to be revealed.</p>
<p>This may tend to throw some light upon what are called
anthropomorphic ideas of God.&nbsp; These have sometimes been
spoken of as inadequate, and degrading.&nbsp; Inadequate they
certainly are, as every notion which we can have of the Deity
must be; but we are unable to see in what way they are
degrading.&nbsp; Almost every nation, following apparently the
necessity of our nature, has clothed its gods in the objective
form of some familiar animal, or other existence, and endowed
them with qualities of which they had experience.&nbsp; What
wonder then if God, seeing that He must, unless the conditions of
our nature were altered, make use of ideas with which we are
already familiar, should adopt an anthropomorphic representation
of Himself, purified, exalted, and adapted, as far as possible,
to His own infinite perfections?&nbsp; In fact, we know not how
God could declare Himself as just, righteous, pure, and loving,
or reveal our responsibility to Himself, without a reference to
man, inasmuch as he is the only being, of which we have any
actual experience, who possesses, even in a limited degree,
qualities of such a description.&nbsp; Assuredly then it cannot
be a degrading notion of the Deity to regard Him as invested with
the highest attributes of which we have a conception.&nbsp; We
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>are aware that some philosophers talk much of the
Infinite, and the Absolute, as conveying more exalted notions of
the Divine Being.&nbsp; What the exact meaning of those terms is
philosophers find it difficult to declare, and the common people
are almost wholly unable to understand.&nbsp; Certainly such
highly abstract terms convey little distinct meaning.&nbsp; It
will be found upon examination, that the word
&ldquo;Infinite,&rdquo; to stir in any degree the depths of our
nature, must be combined with some quality with which we are
familiar.&nbsp; Infinite love, infinite justice, infinite purity,
are things which we can in some degree understand and appreciate;
but the point which we understand best is not the
&ldquo;Infinite,&rdquo; but the finite,&mdash;the love,&mdash;the
justice,&mdash;the purity; and these are ideas taken from what we
find in some imperfect degree in ourselves.&nbsp; To those who
believe that man was made &ldquo;in the image of God,&rdquo; and
that the Word, being God, became also man, the train of thought
here indicated will come home with additional force.</p>
<p>What has been said with regard to a revelation, made by words,
applies, in its main points, to a revelation made directly to the
mind through <i>ideas</i>, without the intervention of
words.&nbsp; To see this clearly, let us bear in mind the
distinction between a perception and an idea.&nbsp; An idea is
the result of a perception.&nbsp; We perceive a rose when it is
presented to our senses, and we see, smell, or touch it.&nbsp; We
have an idea of it, when, not being any longer presented, we
think of it, and call to mind its qualities.&nbsp; We are said to
have a perception of anger, or love, or any other emotion, when
those feelings are present to the mind.&nbsp; We have ideas of
them, when we think about them.&nbsp; It is not our object to
enter upon any abstruse discussion as to the origin of
ideas.&nbsp; What has <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>been just advanced will be generally
admitted by metaphysicians, and readily understood by
others.&nbsp; Hoping, then, that the distinction between an idea
and a perception will be carried in the mind, we will proceed
with our argument.&nbsp; There is no difficulty in
supposing&mdash;and this, we believe, corresponds very closely to
an opinion commonly entertained respecting inspiration&mdash;that
God could, without the intervention of words, call up in the mind
such ideas as He might think fit.&nbsp; For instance, instead of
speaking the words, &ldquo;Thou shalt do no murder,&rdquo; He
might, in a preternatural manner, excite in the mind the ideas
corresponding to them.&nbsp; Still, however, unless we suppose
the conditions of human thought to be altered in a manner for
which we have no analogy, the ideas of a man, killing, etc., must
previously exist in the mind, or the revelation would be
unintelligible.&nbsp; Whether, then, the ideas are called up,
through the instrumentality of words, or in some other way, is
immaterial to our present argument.&nbsp; The point we insist on
is that, except in the case of actual perception, the
communication of knowledge, by revelation, or otherwise, <i>must
be limited by the ideas previously existing in the mind of the
person to whom the communication is made</i>.&nbsp; These ideas
may be combined into new forms, and new relations may be
discovered between them, or they may be analyzed into their
constituent parts, but we cannot transcend the ideas themselves,
except by new perceptions.</p>
<p>Let it not, however, be imagined that a revelation, conveyed
through the instrumentality of ideas previously existing, must be
so narrow as to convey little or no new information, or
instruction.&nbsp; We have only to look at the works of Milton,
Newton, Shakespeare, and other great men, to see the almost
endless variety with which <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>ideas, and
the relations in which they stand to each other, may be so
combined and disposed, as to minister to the imagination, or
enrich the mind with fresh stores of knowledge.&nbsp; All the
information which we derive from books, or conversation, is
obtained in this way, and to it we must probably attribute by far
the largest portion of our mental acquisitions, after the period
of childhood.&nbsp; So far, indeed, as the promulgation of a
revelation by its original recipients is concerned, it appears
plain that it must be made, almost necessarily, through the
instrumentality of words, inasmuch as they are the best signs
which can be made use of in the communication of knowledge.</p>
<p>Before, however, proceeding to this portion of the subject, it
appears desirable to make a few additional observations with
regard to a revelation by <i>perception</i>.&nbsp; We have
already had occasion to notice that &ldquo;the Deity does not,
like other objects, come within the direct cognizance of our
perceptive faculties&rdquo; (p. 5), and that, &ldquo;even if a
direct presentation of the Infinite were given . . . the result
would be a finite conception&rdquo; (p. 12).&nbsp; It may,
however, be imagined that a direct presentation, even though
issuing in a finite conception, or a representation either
addressed <i>ab extra</i> to our perceptive faculties, or brought
before us in a vision, or a dream, or otherwise, would convey to
the mind a more correct apprehension of God&rsquo;s nature than
could be obtained in any other way.&nbsp; These cases, though
differing in some particulars, may, for our present purpose, be
regarded as identical, and treated as perceptions.&nbsp; Now
there can be no doubt that a perception conveys a more vivid
impression to the mind than a description; and we may, therefore,
reasonably suppose that, in a revelation, God might use this <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>method of communicating knowledge in those cases to
which it might be specially adapted.&nbsp; Thus, for instance, if
God designed to give an idea of some place or being which we had
never seen, He might effect this, in a very perfect manner, by
bringing such a place or being, either in reality, or by
representation, within the range of our perceptive
faculties.&nbsp; The appearance vouchsafed by God to Moses (Exod.
xxxiii. 19&ndash;23), the vision of Ezekiel (Ezek. xxxvii.
1&ndash;10), and the description given by St. Paul (2 Cor. xii.
1&ndash;4), will serve as illustrations of our meaning.</p>
<p>It must not, however, be taken for granted that such a mode of
revelation would, in every case, be possible; or that, if
possible, it would always be the best method of
communication.&nbsp; So far as we can see, no mere presentation,
or representation of the Deity, could, in itself, give any deep
insight into His moral character, or the relation in which He
stands to us.&nbsp; Even if the Deity were constantly present, we
know not how we could obtain any accurate knowledge of His
attributes, except by observation of His words and acts.&nbsp; If
we had been introduced to the philanthropist, Howard, we could
not have become acquainted with his excellence by merely gazing
at his countenance.&nbsp; We must have listened to his words, and
followed him to those scenes of misery which he was in the habit
of visiting, if we would obtain a clear understanding of his
benevolence.&nbsp; So too, the holiness, love, and other moral
perfections of the Deity, are not matters which can be
apprehended from any mere intuition of the Divine nature.&nbsp; A
glorious exhibition of the Divine presence, such, for instance,
as that described in Exodus, as having occurred on Mount Sinai,
might inspire feelings of awe, and enable those <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>who witnessed
it to apprehend more clearly, perhaps, than could have been
effected in any other way, the dignity and majesty of God; but,
for a revelation of His moral nature, and the relation in which
He stands to man, we must look more to words&mdash;such words,
for instance, as He is said to have spoken to the children of
Israel at that time, and afterwards, during forty days, to
Moses.&nbsp; While, then, we think that a revelation by
perception, with regard to some things, might be expected, we do
not consider that it would convey a large amount of information,
unless it were combined with a revelation through words.&nbsp;
Words are, in fact, the most natural and effectual mode of
imparting most kinds of knowledge, and we may, therefore,
reasonably expect that, in any revelation which the Divine Being
might think fit to make to man, they would form a chief method of
communication.&nbsp; When we thus speak of words in connection
with a revelation, we do not mean only words addressed actually
to the ear, but also such, as in a dream or vision, may appear to
be spoken.&nbsp; We desire also that it should be remembered
that, for the main purpose of our argument, it is not so much
words as <i>ideas</i> which we wish to keep in view.&nbsp; What
we chiefly wish to leave on the mind is, that a revelation,
except so far as a new perception may be given, <i>must be
limited by the ideas previously existing in the mind of the
person to whom it is made</i>.&nbsp; It may be reasonably
expected that God would make use of those ideas which were best
adapted to His purpose, but not that He should transcend the
ideas themselves.&nbsp; If, too, we suppose that a new perception
is given, that perception could not be explained to others,
except through the instrumentality of such ideas as those to
which we have referred.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Our object hitherto has been to explain the conditions
under which a direct revelation from God may be expected to be
<i>given</i>.&nbsp; If we have been able to remove from the minds
of our readers vague and indefinite notions on the subject, and
to put, in their place, something clearer and more distinct, our
object thus far will have been answered.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to state that, by what has
been said above, we do not intend to intimate that the recipient
of a direct revelation must, necessarily, always understand the
exact meaning of such a revelation.&nbsp; It may contain a hidden
meaning, to be evident at some future time.&nbsp; Thus, for
instance, on the supposition that the first chapter of Ezekiel is
a revelation from God, it is probable that the meaning of it was
as unintelligible to Ezekiel, as it is generally considered to be
at the present time.&nbsp; But the meaning of the words
themselves, and their connection with each other are clear.&nbsp;
It is in the application that the difficulty arises.&nbsp; So,
too, as advances are made in knowledge, words, and the ideas
belonging to them, acquire a more extended and fuller
meaning.&nbsp; The ideas involved in the word, <i>sun</i>, are
very different to the philosopher and the peasant; and some ideas
contained in a revelation may be of such a kind as not to be
fully understood till more knowledge has been acquired, than
existed at the time when the revelation was made.&nbsp; But to
suppose that the words convey no meaning to the original
recipient of the revelation, is to say that no revelation is made
to him at all, and it certainly hardly appears probable that the
Divine Being should make a communication which could answer no
end to the person to whom it was addressed.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>3.&nbsp; We now proceed to an examination of the
conditions under which <i>a revelation may be recorded</i>, <i>or
otherwise made known by the person who has received it</i>.&nbsp;
Here we see at once that, for all practical purposes, the method
of communication must be <i>words</i>; for it is not necessary to
take into account such visual representations as might be made to
the eye by painting or otherwise.&nbsp; Words may be oral, or
written.&nbsp; As the latter are more likely to be well weighed
and definite than the former, and are, moreover, better
calculated to hand down a truth from age to age, we shall confine
our attention to them, although what we have to say is, in a
great degree, applicable to spoken words also.&nbsp; We start
with the supposition that God has already made known to some
particular person, as perfectly as He has thought fit, and, it
may be, as perfectly as the nature of the subject admitted, or
the capability of the person to whom the communication has been
made would allow, some truth which is to be recorded for the
benefit of the present, and future generations.&nbsp; The
question we have to answer is,&mdash;how this may be most
effectually accomplished.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, in the case of a revelation, made by
words, <i>the words might be recorded exactly as they were
delivered</i>.&nbsp; The words which God is said to have spoken
on Mount Sinai, and to have written afterwards, on two tables of
stone, may serve as an exemplification of our meaning.&nbsp; In
this case God is described as writing them with His own hand: but
they might have been written, with equal truthfulness, by any of
those who had heard them.&nbsp; If future generations had
convincing evidence that they possessed a faithful record of what
God said, and the meaning of the words had not changed during the
lapse of time, the revelation would be as perfect to them as it
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>was to the original recipients.&nbsp; So, too, if God,
instead of speaking the words of the ten commandments, had, in
some way which should authenticate the reality of the revelation,
called up in the mind of Moses the ideas corresponding to the
words, and he had faithfully written them down; those words would
convey as full a revelation to those who read them, as that which
Moses himself had experienced.&nbsp; Both these would be verbal
revelations in the strict sense of the word.&nbsp; They would be,
in fact, the very words of God Himself.&nbsp; If any book,
professing to be a revelation from God, could be proved to be
entirely of this description, there would be little or no room
for discussion about it.&nbsp; The only things which could give
rise to dispute would be such as attach to the interpretation of
all records.&nbsp; Questions might be asked as to the exact
meaning of the words, and inquiries might be raised as to whether
they retained the same meaning which they had when they were
originally written down: but any dispute which might arise on
these points would be confined within very narrow limits, and
would moreover be of such a character, as could not be avoided,
unless God were to make a revelation afresh in every age, and we
may add, perhaps, to every individual,&mdash;a supposition which
would be contrary to analogy, and in the highest degree
improbable.&nbsp; Thus far there is no practical difficulty.</p>
<p>Is it, however, necessary to the idea of a recorded revelation
that the exact words, neither <i>more nor less</i>, as spoken by
God, or as expressing ideas which He has called up in the mind of
the person to whom He has revealed Himself, should be written
down?&nbsp; A recorded revelation, we must remember, is designed
chiefly for the benefit of future generations, and it may
therefore very properly leave out much which was only of passing
interest.&nbsp; God <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>might have revealed many things to
Abraham, which were highly important for him to know, but in
which we may have no interest.&nbsp; We can easily see then that,
in any record which God might authorize, such things would very
probably be omitted.&nbsp; Thus far again there is no practical
difficulty.</p>
<p>To proceed a step further.&nbsp; Is there any reason to expect
that, in a record of a revelation, the original words, either as
spoken by God, or as expressive of the ideas which He had called
up in the mind of the recipient, might be in any decree
<i>altered</i>?&mdash;and, would every alteration necessarily
make the record less a revelation from God than it was
before?&nbsp; These are questions which we shall endeavour to
answer.</p>
<p>It may be observed, in the first place, that the same train of
thought which applies to an original revelation from God, applies
also, in its main points, to the record of it.&nbsp; Both in the
one case, and the other, it appears reasonable to expect that God
would not, to a greater extent than was absolutely necessary,
transcend or interfere with those natural powers in man which He
had Himself implanted.&nbsp; As the giving of a revelation would,
as already shewn, be conformed in a great degree to the usual
conditions under which knowledge is imparted, so also, it seems
reasonable to expect that the record of a revelation would as far
as possible be conformed to the usual conditions under which
knowledge is recorded.</p>
<p>In looking at the conditions under which a revelation must be
recorded, it is obvious that the difference of languages, which
prevails in this world, presents an insuperable obstacle to an
exact record of words being continued.&nbsp; It may indeed be
alleged that God could cause a revelation to be recorded, in its
exact words, in each distinct <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>language.&nbsp; We hardly think however that such a view
as this will be seriously entertained by any one.&nbsp; Not to
mention how completely contrary this would be to what analogy
would lead us to expect, we may observe that, as languages are
continually undergoing changes, such a method of recording must
be continually renewed; and, moreover, as language does not
convey precisely the same ideas to any two individuals, it would
be almost needful that a separate record, or rather a separate
revelation, should be made for each person.&nbsp; Such views as
these require only to be stated to shew that they are untenable;
but, if they are untenable, it is plain that the
<i>continuance</i> of an exact record of words cannot be
expected.</p>
<p>But may it not be expected that, at least, <i>one</i> exact
record would be made of any revelation which God might think fit
to give, and that this would afford the best guarantee which
could be had for future truthfulness?&nbsp; In answering this
question it is very important to draw a distinction.&nbsp; <i>The
words of the record may be exactly such words as God approves
of</i>, <i>although they may not be the precise words in which
the original revelation was made</i>.&nbsp; In some particular
instances God might determine that the precise words of the
revelation should be used, while in others He might think fit
that it should be otherwise.&nbsp; In either case the record
would be a true one, and each method of recording might have its
own peculiar advantages.&nbsp; Under some circumstances it might
be desirable that not the slightest deviation from the precise
mode of expression which God had communicated should be made;
while under others, the human view&mdash;by which we here mean
the view of the particular person to whom the revelation is
made&mdash;might be recorded, and add to it a force which could
hardly be had in any other way.&nbsp; So <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>long as the
record is such as God approves of, every requisite to a true
record is complied with.&nbsp; If a minister of state were
commissioned to make a communication to a foreign court, he might
write down the whole or a part of it in his own words, and, if
his own court approved of the words, contained in the writing,
the object in view would be answered.&nbsp; We can even
understand that, in some respects, the communication might gain
force by this mode of proceeding.&nbsp; The
&eta;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf; of the writer would be manifested,
and carry with it a certain degree of weight.&nbsp; There would
be the weight which attached to the document as emanating from
the government, and there might be an additional weight from the
character of the person who had been entrusted to write, and,
perhaps, carry out, in some degree, the requirements of, the
dispatch.&nbsp; In the case of a recorded revelation, it appears
then probable that God would permit those feelings and powers
which He has implanted in man, and which exert such a strong
influence on others, to do their work, subject, however, to His
own control and guidance.&nbsp; In this way there would be a
Divine and a human aspect of the record; a Divine and a human
power in it.&nbsp; All of it would be the truth of God, and it
would be presented to us in a manner peculiarly adapted to our
condition, and likely to ensure our acceptance of it.&nbsp; At
the very least such a method of recording would be exactly
consistent with truthfulness.</p>
<p>We may go a step further, and say that it would be difficult,
if not impossible, to conceive any circumstances under which the
record should not bear a human aspect.&nbsp; If the views
propounded in the former part of these &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo;
with regard to the conditions under which a revelation must be
made, and especially with respect to <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>anthropomorphic views of God, be correct, a revelation
<i>must</i> assume, in some measure, a human aspect.&nbsp; But if
the human aspect must exist in the presentation, it must also in
the record.&nbsp; The only question which is really open to
discussion is, whether there should be the <i>same</i> human
aspect in the record, as in the original revelation; in other
words, whether it may be expected that God would always present
that particular human aspect in the original revelation which He
considered best adapted for the record.&nbsp; For the reasons
already assigned it does not seem probable that this would be the
case.</p>
<p>It must be remembered, moreover, that in the case of a
revelation, made at different times, and to different persons,
either the character of each individual writer must be manifested
in the record, or some other character, alien perhaps to that of
the writer, and certainly not equally adapted to that of all the
readers, must be adopted.&nbsp; Which method of record appears
the most probable, and the most calculated to promote the object
of a revelation&mdash;namely, to instruct and influence
mankind&mdash;it does not appear very difficult to
determine.&nbsp; It seems, then, that a variety of style may be
expected in the records written by different persons of the
revelations which they have received.&nbsp; As has been before
observed, all that is essential to the truthfulness of the record
is that God should approve of it.</p>
<p>A question may possibly arise here as to the precise
<i>manner</i> in which the words may be so recorded, as to convey
a true account of God&rsquo;s revelation.&nbsp; In endeavouring
to supply an answer, it should be remembered, in the first place,
that in the ordinary affairs of life no great difficulty occurs
with regard to the transmission of a message.&nbsp; If the person
who has been selected to convey it, has sufficient <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>intelligence to understand it, and is, moreover,
desirous to deliver it faithfully, he is, in most cases, able
either to speak, or write it, in his own words, in such a manner
as to convey the right meaning to others.&nbsp; So, too, with
regard to a revelation; if the person to whom it has been made
rightly apprehends it, and endeavours to record it honestly, the
probability is great that the record which he makes will be a
true one.&nbsp; If, too, we are prepared, in accordance with the
common belief in all ages, to admit that God can, and at times
does, exercise a control over the minds of men, it is reasonable
to believe that He would do this, when the object was to furnish
a correct record for the benefit of future ages.&nbsp; This
control might be exercised either consciously, or unconsciously
to the writer.&nbsp; All that would be needful for the
truthfulness of the record is, that it should be exercised in
some way.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>4.&nbsp; We will now proceed to offer some remarks as to the
conditions under which <i>a revelation may be expected to be
transmitted</i>.&nbsp; Much of what has been said, with regard to
the recording of a revelation, by the person to whom it was
originally made, applies to the transmission of such a record to
future generations, and its translation into other
languages.&nbsp; If a belief (in what way originated we do not
now stop to enquire) in the reality of the recorded revelation
existed, the greatest care would naturally be taken in making
copies from it, and also in translating it.&nbsp; Well-known
examples of this are to be found in the care which the Jews of
old used in making new copies of their sacred books, and also in
the fact that, in our own country, no printers, but those
appointed by the Queen, are permitted to publish the authorized
version of the <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Bible.&nbsp; It can hardly be
considered possible that those who believed in the reality of a
recorded revelation, and valued it, would not take care to hand
it down in a correct form to others; and, although incorrect,
mutilated, and interpolated copies, might, in some instances, be
made by other persons, it does not seem likely that these would
prevail to such an extent, as to prevent the true record from
maintaining its ground.&nbsp; Such dishonest copies would hardly
be made at all, till considerable interest had been manifested in
the revelation; and <i>then</i> any variations from the correct
copies would scarcely pass without challenge, and correction.</p>
<p>It appears then, that, as the ordinary mode of recording,
copying, and translating important communications are usually
found sufficiently adequate for their several purposes, such
methods might be employed with success in regard to a revelation:
and it also seems probable that God would not interfere with such
methods more than was absolutely necessary for the purpose He had
in view.&nbsp; If we suppose that God exercised, throughout the
whole process of transmission, that controlling power to which
reference has been made; then there would be a correct record in
each age.&nbsp; That God should exercise that power to such an
extent as to prevent every possibility of error, in the
transmission of the record, or of mistake as to its meaning in
the minds of those who read it, would be contrary to the analogy
of His dealings with us in other things.&nbsp; We possess
faculties, by the due exercise of which we are enabled to arrive
at a sufficiently accurate knowledge of those things which are
essential to our wellbeing, but we are not, by infallible
guidance, preserved from error.&nbsp; If we were, our
responsibility <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>would to a great extent cease.&nbsp;
All that can be reasonably expected, in the case under
consideration, is that the record should be transmitted with such
exactness, as that an honest inquirer should be able to ascertain
its authenticity, and understand its meaning, so far as God
designed that he should know it.&nbsp; We say&mdash;so far as God
designed that he should know it,&mdash;because it is quite
conceivable that there might be mysteries in a revelation, the
meaning of which would not be made clear till the time determined
beforehand by God should arrive.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>5.&nbsp; To enter into a full examination, as to what would
constitute sufficient grounds for <i>accepting</i> a professed
revelation, would open too wide a field of enquiry for our
present purpose, and would necessitate a discussion of that very
difficult branch of metaphysics which relates to the laws which
regulate our belief.&nbsp; Without, however, attempting to
discuss the subject fully, a few points may be indicated for
consideration.</p>
<p>It is clear that the evidence, with regard to the record of a
professed revelation, <i>will vary in its character at different
times</i>.&nbsp; The evidence will be more direct, and, in this
respect, more clear, at an earlier period of the record, than at
a later: while, on the other hand, a record which has been
translated into different languages, and has exercised a widely
spread influence, will possess a peculiar force of its own.&nbsp;
On the supposition that God made a revelation to Moses, it is not
difficult to suppose that convincing evidence, as to the
truthfulness of what he might say, or write about it, might
readily be afforded to those who lived in his times.&nbsp; If
such miracles, as those recorded in the Pentateuch really <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>occurred&mdash;and certainly if God so far transcended
the usual course of nature as to give a revelation, it does not
seem hard to believe that He might also so far transcend it, as
to authenticate it in some special manner&mdash;the evidence
would be of a very strong kind.&nbsp; To say, however, that no
reasonable conviction of the reality of a revelation could be
afforded, without the aid of miracles, is an assertion which we
are not prepared to hazard; though we certainly think that, as
calculated to excite attention, and implying a power superior to
that of man, they would serve as excellent credentials.&nbsp; To
human view, in fact, a miracle does not necessarily imply the
agency of the one God.&nbsp; It might, for anything that can be
proved to the contrary, be the work of some power, inferior to
that God whom we are bound to obey, and yet superior to
man.&nbsp; The various circumstances therefore, connected with
the miracle, would be properly taken into account by the person
who was investigating a professed revelation.&nbsp; He would not
only examine with care the evidence as to the reality of the
miracle itself, but also the circumstances under which it was
worked, and its aspect.&nbsp; The character of the person who
professed to have received the revelation would very fairly come
under consideration.&nbsp; Inquiries would be made as to whether
he was one whose word could be safely trusted, and whether he
possessed sufficient intelligence, to render it probable that he
would arrive at a right conclusion.&nbsp; A man of known
truthfulness and intelligence would justly meet with more ready
credence, than a person of an opposite character.</p>
<p>The revelation itself, too, would be closely
scrutinized.&nbsp; In some cases it is conceivable that the
revelation would <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>go far to prove itself.&nbsp; It
might make known things which, though not perhaps discoverable by
man&rsquo;s reason, were nevertheless so agreeable to it, as to
carry with them an almost irresistible conviction.&nbsp; As, too,
a revelation would be given for the practical guidance of man, it
would probably be attended with threatenings and promises, or
other predictions; and when the things which had been foretold
actually took place, the reality of the revelation would be, to a
great extent, established.&nbsp; If, for instance, the remarkable
occurrences which Moses, on various occasions, foretold, as about
to take place in the land of Egypt, really occurred, it would, we
think, be very difficult to avoid the conclusion that he had
received a revelation from God, and that what he said, or wrote,
was to be depended upon.&nbsp; A candid inquirer would also
examine, in a reverent spirit, whether the professed revelation
was likely to promote a pure morality, and to further the best
interests of mankind.&nbsp; He would not, indeed, enter upon such
an examination, with the feeling that he was competent to decide,
in <i>every</i> respect, as to the justice and excellence of the
statements which professed to be revealed; for his reason, if
consulted, would tell him that many circumstances might be hidden
from him, without which a correct judgment could not be formed,
and that, possibly, his capacity might not be able to grasp them
in all their relations, even if they were put before him.&nbsp;
Still, such an examination as that which we have just referred
to, would properly form an element in leading to a conclusion,
and, when combined with others, would give as reasonable grounds
for arriving at a decision with respect to a professed
revelation, as we should be willing to act on in the usual
business of life, and <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>would, therefore, be suited to the
conditions of our being.&nbsp; The decision arrived at would
commonly be the result, not of a single proof, but of many
concurrent circumstances.</p>
<p>What has been said in reference to an examination, instituted
by persons living at the time when a professed revelation was
made, is obviously applicable, in many respects, to those who
should live in later times, and also to the original recipients
themselves.&nbsp; With regard to evidence in later times, it may
be added that the original believers in the record, and their
followers in each succeeding age, would naturally be subjected to
an examination, as to their truthfulness and intelligence, and
thus a chain of evidence would be continually kept up.&nbsp; The
larger, too, the number, and the more intelligent the character
of those who believed in it, the greater would be the presumption
in its favour.&nbsp; If the record were received generally by any
nation, the <i>onus probandi</i> would in that case lie with
those who impugned it.&nbsp; The record itself also would, from
time to time, be submitted to such fair rules of criticism as
apply to other documents, the fact however being remembered, that
it professed to be the word of God, and, therefore, that evidence
of its authenticity, rather than of its exact coincidence with
human reason, was to be mainly looked for.</p>
<p>We have now indicated, although very briefly and imperfectly,
a few points for consideration, as to the transmission of a
recorded revelation, and what might constitute sufficient grounds
for accepting it as true; and we trust that what has been said
will suffice to show that there would be no great difficulty in
so handing it down, as that it should convey to the candid
inquirer, in each succeeding age, reasonable evidence of its
reality.</p>
<p>It may, however, be argued, that, although such <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>evidence, as has been indicated, might well convince
those who had time and ability to institute a searching
examination, the case is different with regard to others; and
that, as a revelation may be presumed to have a most important
bearing upon the interests of all, there should be some more easy
method by which it may be tested.&nbsp; Now, we are quite
prepared to admit that every one should have sufficient grounds
afforded him for arriving at a decision; but, at the same time,
we do not conceive that a thorough examination of the evidence,
made by each person for himself, is the only, or even principal,
method by which a safe conclusion may be reached.&nbsp; Each
individual has commonly some peculiar talent, in the exercise of
which he reaches an excellence, which others, whose abilities and
pursuits are of a different character, do not attain to.&nbsp;
The astronomer works out conclusions, which, those, whose
attention has been directed to other subjects, could never have
reached, but which they may nevertheless, with propriety, accept
as true.&nbsp; It is not every one who has time or ability to
sift evidence on theological subjects, or to criticise
manuscripts; but the labours of those who have given their
attention to such things may, it is evident, justly be available
for the benefit of others.&nbsp; Even the wisest person accepts
as true much on the testimony of others, and that often on
subjects with which he is conversant.&nbsp; When his judgment is
most independent he will find, if he analyzes it, that much is
borrowed.&nbsp; There is nothing contrary to sound reason in all
this.&nbsp; Without it, little progress could be made in
anything.&nbsp; Without it, each succeeding age, instead of
standing on the platform which had been raised by that which
preceded it, would have the weary task of commencing afresh, and
could thus <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>make few accessions to
knowledge.&nbsp; Trustfulness is as much a part of man&rsquo;s
constitution, as reasoning or any other intellectual
process.&nbsp; Should it be said that men often trust wrongly; it
may be replied with equal force that they as frequently reason
wrongly.&nbsp; Probably there is less difficulty in ascertaining
where we may safely trust, than in weighing evidence properly, or
carrying out correctly a train of reasoning.&nbsp; Certainly
people have little difficulty, if they use their faculties
aright, in selecting a fit adviser in law or medicine.&nbsp; Why
should there be a greater difficulty with regard to
religion?&nbsp; We do not mean that anyone would be justified in
so placing himself under the guidance of another, as to <i>give
up</i> the exercise of his own judgment altogether; but, that he
may properly make use of the counsel of others, and that often to
such an extent as to overrule his own views in <i>forming</i> his
judgment.</p>
<p>There is another consideration, connected with this portion of
the subject, which well deserves attention.&nbsp; A conclusion
may be a very correct one, and may have been reached by a very
satisfactory process, although the person who has made it, may be
unable to state the grounds upon which it rests, or meet the
objections which may be made against it.&nbsp; This applies not
only to those cases, where the conclusion mainly rests upon
trust, but also to others.&nbsp; An eminent statesman recommended
a person going out in an official capacity, to give his decisions
confidently, but not to venture to declare the reasons.&nbsp; The
decisions would probably be right, but the reasons, as <i>stated
by him</i>, might not be.&nbsp; It need not be inferred from this
that the reasons upon which he would really act were wrong, but
rather that from want of practice, or power of analysis, or some
other cause, he <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>would be unable to bring them out
correctly.&nbsp; The processes of thought pass so rapidly through
the mind, that even the most practised thinkers often find it
difficult to arrest them in their progress, and state the various
steps by which they have arrived at their conclusions.&nbsp; The
simplest and most certain grounds of our conclusions are, in
fact, not unfrequently those which it is most difficult to bring
out into distinct view.&nbsp; They have so often passed through
the mind that we have ceased to notice them, although, all the
while, they contribute essentially to the judgment which is
formed; or they lie so far back, in the depths of our
consciousness, that it is almost impossible to recover
them.&nbsp; Necessarily, nothing can be so simple, or so certain,
in one sense, as intuitions, that is, those things which we know
or believe without any intermediate process of thought, and yet,
down to the present time, those who have most deeply studied the
subject hesitate to decide exactly as to what are intuitions, and
what are not.&nbsp; We conclude then that, while, on the one
hand, we should not discredit the rational powers of men, as if
they were unequal to perform the task allotted to them; we must
not, on the other, be easily shaken with regard to conclusions
which have been made with care and consideration, because we may
be unable to trace out accurately the arguments by which they are
supported, or answer the objections which are made against
them.</p>
<p>We have now considered revelation with regard to the
conditions under which it may be expected to be <i>given</i>,
<i>recorded</i>, and <i>transmitted</i>, with a view to its being
<i>accepted and believed</i>.&nbsp; We do not for a moment
suppose that we have removed every difficulty; but if we have
upon the whole, made clear to our readers the nature of <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>these
conditions, or, where this has not been done, indicated the
points at which difficulties exist, our chief purpose will have
been answered.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>6.&nbsp; Here we might leave the subject, but we cannot
forbear adding some further observations in reference to that
professed revelation of God&rsquo;s will which is to be found in
the Bible.&nbsp; It is not our intention to attempt a summary of
the various evidences which exist to show that it is a real one;
nor is it our design to reply at length to the objections which
have been made to invalidate it.&nbsp; There are however some
obvious facts which meet us on the threshold of the inquiry, and
which can be estimated at their just value by any candid
inquirer, to which we would direct attention.</p>
<p>We find for instance that the Bible contains a purer system of
morality, and conveys a clearer insight into the unity and nature
of God, than is to be found in any other book; and that, although
it is the composition of men, many of them ignorant and
unlearned, who have lived at different times, and occupied very
dissimilar positions in life, there is, nevertheless, a wonderful
similarity in the main outlines of religious truth, as delivered
by all the writers.&nbsp; We know, however, still further, that
the morality and precepts of the Bible, although confessedly of a
pure and holy character, are, nevertheless, not of such a kind as
to fall in with the wishes and passions of mankind.&nbsp; To
believe that morality must extend to thoughts as well as actions,
and that an all-seeing God notices, and will one day call all men
to a strict account, is not a matter which, if we may judge from
what we see around us, is agreeable to the feelings of most
men.&nbsp; Nor, if we look to the great remedy proposed for the
sin of man, such, we mean, as it is supposed to be, by the <!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>great majority of professing Christians, namely, the
atoning sacrifice made by the Son of God, do we find here again a
matter which either the reason or the feelings of men generally
are ready to lead them to adopt.&nbsp; We see too, that in all
ages unbelief has, more or less, existed, and objections have
been, from time to time, brought forward which appeared likely to
have considerable power in undermining the existing belief in the
Bible.&nbsp; Persecution also has exercised its influence, and,
it might frequently have been supposed, according to human
calculations, that it would have availed to destroy all credence
in it.&nbsp; And yet, notwithstanding all these circumstances, to
which we have referred, it is an incontrovertible fact that a
professed belief in the Bible, as a revelation from God, exists
most widely.&nbsp; It is, we may add, not a little worthy of
being remarked that the nomenclature of the Bible has obtained
such a strong hold on the public mind, in our own day, that many
who deny inspiration in any distinctive sense, still retain the
use of this and other words, as if afraid to make it plain how
far they differ from those opinions which are commonly
received.</p>
<p>The present age is certainly more enlightened than any which
has preceded it; but, hitherto at least, a professed belief in
the orthodox doctrines of religion has increased rather than
diminished.&nbsp; We find moreover that persons of all ranks, and
every kind of mental calibre, have declared that they find
something in the Bible which they do not find in any other book;
something, in fact, which, when duly received, comes home to
their hearts as men, and seems admirably adapted to the deepest
wants of human nature.&nbsp; We see too that those who appear to
have accepted the Bible most fully, and to hold <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it most
firmly, have been so much impressed with a sense of its
importance to the world at large, as to have endeavoured, often
at considerable risk and expense, to communicate to others, both
at-home and abroad, the knowledge of those things which they have
received as truths&mdash;a method of proceeding which has not
been adopted, and, in fact, could not have been, without a
manifest absurdity, by those who profess to believe in the
inspiration of Plato, Milton, Shakespeare, and other great, but,
according to common opinion, uninspired men.&nbsp; All these and
various other considerations which might be adduced seem to mark
out the Bible, as being a book at least <i>different</i> from all
other books, and to lead to the presumption that it may contain
that knowledge of God which, as has been remarked in the earlier
part of these &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo; it appears most important
for men to be acquainted with, and a revelation of which, in some
way or other, has been very commonly believed in.&nbsp; Assuredly
there is a strong presumption in its favour, and the <i>onus
probandi</i>, in our own day, lies with those who deny its claims
to acceptance.&nbsp; Whether however the Bible actually is, or
contains a revelation from God is still a fair subject for
reverent examination.</p>
<p>Without attempting to enter upon such an examination here, we
may, without impropriety, offer a suggestion as to the
<i>spirit</i> in which it should be conducted.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that the examination of a theological, or any other
subject which bears upon the interests of our daily lives,
involves principles of a very different character from those
which are connected with an investigation of the science of
number, or any other abstract science.&nbsp; Mathematical and
numerical investigations advance from principles which are
clearly defined, and almost universally <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>acknowledged
to be self-evident; the reasoning also is of such a kind as to
preclude the admission of error.&nbsp; In theology the case is
different.&nbsp; There, it is difficult to define with accuracy
the points from which the reasoning commences, and also to
exclude, with certainty, the possibility of error in the
reasoning itself.&nbsp; There is, too, another essential
difference between abstract sciences and other subjects of
inquiry.&nbsp; It is not only self-evident that two straight
lines cannot enclose a space, but the judgment which the mind
gives on the subject is not in any danger of being disturbed by
the feelings.&nbsp; In theology, however, the matters which come
under consideration are so mixed up with our nearest and dearest
interests, that the feelings are called into play at every step
of the investigation, and a just balance of the judgment cannot
be preserved without the exercise of much care.&nbsp; Hence the
necessity of endeavouring to preserve a candid and unruffled
spirit in all enquiries connected with religion.&nbsp; No doubt
those feelings which a beneficent God has implanted with a view
to assist us in deciding, are to have their due weight; but
certainly there is need of caution, lest they influence us
unduly.&nbsp; If the judge thinks it needful to charge the jury
to dismiss from their minds everything which might tend to
influence their judgments in an improper manner, and attend only
to the evidence, even though the matter about which they have to
decide is usually one in which they have no personal interest; it
certainly does not appear unnecessary to give a similar caution
on a subject, with regard to which feeling has assumed so strong
a form as to give rise to the name, <i>odium
theologicum</i>.&nbsp; We deceive ourselves, if we imagine that
we approach the subject without any danger of judging it
unfairly.&nbsp; This <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>caution, undoubtedly applies to
<i>all</i> who discuss theological questions; but we think that
we shall not be making an unwarranted assertion, if we say that
it applies in a special manner to those who <i>impugn</i> the
Bible revelation, when it is remembered that the doctrines
contained in it, as they have generally been received by those
who are called orthodox Christians, are of such a kind as very
commonly to excite, in the first instance at least, a strong
feeling of opposition.&nbsp; The Bible itself intimates this, and
common experience bears witness to it as being a fact.&nbsp; We
are not now saying that the doctrines of the purity and holiness
of God, the dreadful nature of sin, the need of an atonement, the
inability of man to present himself before God in merits of his
own, and others of a similar kind are true; but we may properly
say that, whether true or false, they are such as frequently
raise a strong feeling of opposition; and therefore that those
who examine them, with the view of ascertaining their character,
stand in <i>special</i> need of the caution to preserve a calm
and candid spirit.</p>
<p>It will not be out of place to introduce here another
consideration which has a bearing upon this part of the subject,
namely, the <i>supernatural aid</i> which the Bible offers
towards the understanding and acceptance of its doctrines.&nbsp;
It is quite conceivable that a state of things might exist in
which such aid would be wholly unnecessary.&nbsp; We might
suppose a case in which the nature of man was so entirely in
harmony with itself, and so exactly attuned to the truths of a
Divine revelation, as readily to accept it, when it was
presented; but the question we have to decide is, whether
man&rsquo;s nature is actually in this state or not.&nbsp;
Observation leads us to believe that it is not.&nbsp; Whether we
accept the scripture <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>statement of the fall or not, we must
not shut our eyes to the fact that it is difficult for virtue to
force its way, while vice has many votaries.&nbsp; However
convincing, abstractedly, the reasons may be to enforce the
claims of virtue, it is evident that they possess but little
power to lead the large majority of mankind.&nbsp; History and
experience testify to this.&nbsp; Scarce any deny the evidence in
favour of virtue, although few are content to be governed by
it.&nbsp; Now it may be fairly presumed that any revelation which
the Divine Being might make would be in the interests of virtue;
it may be reasonably expected too that it would be supported by
strong evidence: but, if, as actual observation makes it clear is
the case, the feelings of mankind are more inclined to reject
than accept the claims of virtue, the evidence, however strong,
will not produce the effect which it would, if the mind were more
justly balanced, and thus the revelation will be in danger of
being rejected.&nbsp; Such rejection, be it remembered, need not
result from any deficiency of evidence, but may arise from an
indisposition to receive it.&nbsp; For our own part we believe
that the evidence in favour of the orthodox views of scripture
statements is far stronger than can be found in support of any
other subject of a like kind: but, at the same time, taking into
consideration the actual tendencies of human nature, we are not
surprised that it does not produce the effect which it should do;
and therefore it appears to us not unreasonable to suppose that
God might exercise some such supernatural power upon the mind, as
the Bible speaks of, with the view of disposing it to the
reception of a revelation.</p>
<p>That God does at times interfere in a manner, out of the usual
course of His Providence, with regard to other matters,
especially in answer to prayer, is believed almost <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>universally.&nbsp; We cannot enter here into a
discussion as to the foundation of the belief; but, certainly so
long as the records of mankind go back, and so far as the
experience of the present day conducts us, the belief has been
entertained, and prayer seems to be the natural expression of
man&rsquo;s heart in all cases of difficulty.&nbsp; Men
<i>will</i> believe in, and appeal to, a supernatural power, and
it is hard to suppose that a tendency so universal and deeply
seated, should have no solid foundation.&nbsp; But if prayer, for
aid and direction from above, is the natural outpouring of
man&rsquo;s heart with regard to the more ordinary affairs of
life, there appears to be no reason why prayer should not be
offered up for counsel and guidance with regard to a professed
revelation, and that an answer should be expected.&nbsp; At
least, it can hardly be said that those have fairly tested the
claims of scripture to be received as a revelation from God, who
have not complied with the conditions which it has laid down as
to the manner in which it should be studied.</p>
<p>We now leave the subject, drawing the attention of our readers
to the prayer of one of our greatest poets, and earnestly hoping
that his prayer may be theirs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . What in me is dark,<br />
Illumine; what is low, raise and support;<br />
That to the height of this great argument<br />
I may assert Eternal Providence,<br />
And justify the ways of God to man.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
